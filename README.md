# NetworkingFundamentalsNotes
- DNS (domain name systems) have two types of servers: recrusive and authoratative. Recrusive takes time to cache the records as it needs to talk to multiple authoritative servers hence why when we try to update our web apps it takes time to see the new updates. 
- Ports are part of TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) which are used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. When you send a TCP message you want it to get the specifc program, ex. requesting a webpage but getting back a mailing service would be a bad request as each program needs to be on its on port.
